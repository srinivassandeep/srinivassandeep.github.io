                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite substantial food waste at both the retail and consumer levels, food insecurity remains a significant concern in the United States. Traditional non-market solutions to food insecurity like food banks have relied heavily on donations. Recently, for-profit, market-driven foodtech platforms have emerged, using technology to address food waste by selling surplus food at discounted prices. However, the extent to which such affordable surplus food effectively reaches food insecure populations is uncertain and depends on factors such as spillover demand from cost-conscious or environmentally motivated consumers, the magnitude of price discounts, and the potential influence of the platforms’ operations on food banks. In this study, we examine the impact of one such platform that partners with supermarkets to sell near-expiration food through its mobile app. Although originally designed to reduce food waste, our results show a statistically significant decline in local food insecurity following the platform’s introduction. We estimate that around 860 individuals per county - approximately 146,000 people in total - experience reduced food insecurity due to the platform. Also, the platform’s impact is more pronounced in counties with higher poverty levels. Further, we find that the platform’s effect is complementary to the role of food banks in addressing food insecurity. Anecdotal evidence points to this effect being driven by the platform’s focus on perishable foods such as produce and fresh meat. These findings emphasize the potential of market-based platforms to work alongside non-market approaches in advancing sustainable development goals. The platforms provide policymakers with an additional tool to combat food insecurity and can partner with food banks to ensure adequate, fresh, and affordable food for vulnerable populations. For retailers, collaborating with such platforms offers a viable avenue to manage surplus perishable inventory, particularly in an environment of increasing regulations on commercial waste disposal.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Food delivery platforms have significantly transformed the restaurant industry and consumers' consumption of restaurant food. In this work, we examine the impact of food delivery platforms on the market structure of the restaurant industry and consumer preferences. Specifically, we focus on which types of restaurants, full-service restaurants versus others, benefit or lose from the presence of these platforms. Using several empirical strategies, we find that platform entry reduces the share of ‘non-full-service’ (NFS) restaurants, driven by faster growth of full-service (FS) restaurants relative to NFS restaurants. To investigate the mechanisms driving this shift, we analyze Google restaurant reviews and find that both the number and proportion of first-time reviews grow more rapidly for FS restaurants, highlighting the role of platforms in reducing discovery and familiarization costs. We examine key aspects of review content to highlight changes in consumer preferences and find that, post-platform-entry, the salience of ‘service & staff’ increases in FS restaurant reviews, while the salience of ‘atmosphere’ increases in NFS restaurant reviews. As delivery becomes commoditized, reviewer attention shifts across restaurant attributes, a pattern consistent with diners treating restaurants as modular bundles with component-specific expectations rather than purely integrated experiences. These insights on platform-induced modularity provide practical guidance for restaurants seeking to adapt to evolving consumer preferences.</p>

                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Maintaining safety in the food supply chain is important for the health of consumers. Consequently, many governments and international bodies emphasize the significance of product traceability throughout the food supply chain. Recently, an increasing number of firms have turned to blockchain technology for their supply chains, drawn by its inherent qualities of transparency and immutability. While numerous studies advocate for its implementation and enumerate potential benefits, empirical evaluations of blockchain’s influence on food safety outcomes remain limited. We use a staggered difference-in-difference approach to empirically investigate the tangible impact of blockchain adoption in relation to food recalls, specifically concerning recall duration and frequency. Our findings indicate that the firms integrating blockchain for supply chain traceability experience shortened recall durations. This result holds valuable implications for businesses, considering the substantial financial burdens posed by recalls, and for policymakers, in terms of safeguarding public health.</p>

                <p><i>"I believe the instructor for this course truly made it so that I wanted to learn. In most other classes, I focus on getting a good grade and passing the class. He made it clear that his objective was for us to truly learn and that it was ok if we stumbled along the way. It made more willing to truly learn the material."</i></p>

                <p><i>"I think one of the majors strengths of this course was definitely the variety of topics covered. I feel like the professor knew a lot about every topic and always seemed to know what he was talking about. I emailed him multiple times throughout the semester and I would usually get helpful responses very quickly."</i></p>

                <p><i>"…he would oftentimes let us fix mistakes we made. I never felt like I was robbed of any points and always knew exactly why I missed points when I missed them. He also was very kind and would give extensions when we needed them."</i></p>

                <p><i>"He helps bring the energy in the room, whether its asking about our day or making joke or having fun activities we can do while learned more about the course."</i></p>
