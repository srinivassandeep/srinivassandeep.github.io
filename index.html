                <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                <p><strong>Topics:</strong> Digital Platforms, Blockchain, Tech-enabled Food Supply Chains, Food Delivery, Food Sustainability</p>
                <p><strong>Methods:</strong> Empirical Research, Causal Inference, Natural Language Processing, Analytical Modeling</p>
                <p>My research interest lies in analyzing the impact of platforms and blockchain on technology-enabled food supply chains.

            <p>I completed my MBA from Faculty of Management Studies (FMS), University of Delhi, India, where I actively pursued research projects and participated in international case competitions. Prior to MBA, I also had a brief stint as an Electrical Engineer at Reliance Industries, Hazira, India. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about soccer (European football) and a long-time supporter of Manchester United.</p>

            <h3>Student Feedback</h3>
            <div class="student-feedback">
                <p><i>"I believe the instructor for this course truly made it so that I wanted to learn. In most other classes, I focus on getting a good grade and passing the class. He made it clear that his objective was for us to truly learn and that it was ok if we stumbled along the way. It made more willing to truly learn the material."</i></p>

                <p><i>"I think one of the majors strengths of this course was definitely the variety of topics covered. I feel like the professor knew a lot about every topic and always seemed to know what he was talking about. I emailed him multiple times throughout the semester and I would usually get helpful responses very quickly."</i></p>

                <p><i>"…he would oftentimes let us fix mistakes we made. I never felt like I was robbed of any points and always knew exactly why I missed points when I missed them. He also was very kind and would give extensions when we needed them."</i></p>

                <p><i>"He helps bring the energy in the room, whether its asking about our day or making joke or having fun activities we can do while learned more about the course."</i></p>

                <p><i>"Sandeep is awesome, highly recommend."</i></p>
