            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Business Administration (Information Systems, Operations Management, Supply Chain and Analytics) at the Gies College of Business, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), jointly advised by Prof. Gautam Pant and Prof. Ujjal Mukherjee.</p>
            <p><strong>I am on the 2025–2026 academic job market.</strong></p>
            <p>Outside of work, I'm passionate about soccer (European football) and a long-time supporter of Manchester United.</p>
            <p>Before joining the PhD program, I worked as a data scientist at two large private sector banks in India. I worked on analytics projects across several functions including Corporate Credit, Forex, Treasury and Commercial Vehicle.</p>
            <p>I completed my MBA from Faculty of Management Studies (FMS), University of Delhi, India, where I actively pursued research projects and participated in international case competitions. Prior to MBA, I also had a brief stint as an Electrical Engineer at Reliance Industries, Hazira, India. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Calicut.</p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My primary research interest lies in analyzing the impact of platforms and blockchain on technology-enabled food supply chains. In my dissertation research, I examine major innovations in the food supply chain over the past decade through a series of studies. I concentrate on societal outcomes such as food insecurity and food safety, and how food delivery platforms are transforming the restaurant industry. In terms of methodologies, I employ various causal inference methods, natural language processing techniques and analytical modeling in my research.</p>
